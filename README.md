# Valentine-s-Day-Card-Animation
This project creates an interactive Valentine's Day card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a visually appealing design that simulates a card emerging from an envelope when hovered over. The use of animations and transitions provides a delightful user experience.
Features
Animated Envelope and Card: The centerpiece of this project is an envelope from which a Valentine's Day card slides out upon mouse hover. The card retracts back into the envelope when the mouse is moved away.
Dynamic Shadow Effect: A shadow beneath the envelope adds depth to the design. This shadow dynamically scales down when the card is pulled out, enhancing the 3D effect.
Heart Decorations: A heart-shaped decoration is positioned on the card, further embellishing the Valentine's theme.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to the viewport size, ensuring that the card remains centered and visually appealing on different devices.
Technical Details
HTML Structure: The project's structure is defined in HTML, where div elements represent the envelope, card, and decorative heart.
CSS Styling: The appearance, including colors, sizes, and initial positions, is styled using CSS. Keyframes and animations are used for the motion of the envelope and the scaling of the shadow.
JavaScript Interactivity: jQuery is utilized to detect mouse events on the container element. These events trigger animations that move the card up and down, simulating the action of pulling a card out of and placing it back into the envelope.
How It Works
Envelope and Card: The envelope is styled to appear as if it's facing the viewer. The card slides out from this envelope when interacted with.
Animation: CSS animations give life to the card and shadow, creating a realistic effect as if the card is being pulled out of the envelope.
Interactivity: Using jQuery, the project listens for mouse enter and leave events on the card container, triggering the animations accordingly.
